My Name is Alam Asy'arie from Indonesia.

I build backend applications that process customs-related invoice data.

My projects focus on parsing documents, extracting HS codes, and computing
tax-related information, with an emphasis on correctness and clear data flow
over framework complexity.

Current work is centered around customs and import processing workflows.
